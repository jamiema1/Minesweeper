# My Personal Project: *Minesweeper*

## Introduction

### What is *Minesweeper*?

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game that requires strategy, and sometimes a bit of luck in order to win. The objective of the game is to locate all mines in a rectangular grid without detonating any of them. The game is relatively simple on small boards, but gets increasingly more difficult as the size and number of mines increase.

### Personal Project

For my project, I plan on designing a *Minesweeper* replica that has all the features of the most common versions of *Minesweeper*, as well as a few more to make the game more interesting and fun. Once this project is complete, anyone should be able to start the application and learn how to play the infamous game of *Minesweeper*.

### Why *Minesweeper*?

I chose to make *Minesweeper* for my project because of my personal interest in the game. Just like other single-player puzzle games that require strategy and logic to beat, such as sudoku, *Minesweeper* appeals to me because of the complex strategy and problem-solving that are required to beat the game. Another reason why I chose *Minesweeper* is because it sounds like a fun challenge for me to make that will test both my knowledge of the Java language and my ability to represent real-world ideas in terms of code.
